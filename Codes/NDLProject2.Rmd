# Introduction

A large proportion of mental illnesses develop by early-adulthood
[@kessler2007age], with up to 75% of major mental illnesses having presented
by age 25 [@solmi2021age]. However, despite the increased need during this
period, the consistency of help via NHS mental health services varies greatly,
particularly around age 18 where patients are transferred from child and adolescent mental health 
services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). Additionally, studies across England have shown that 
the distribution of mental illnesses is not homogeneous across the population,
with sexual identity, ethnic background, level of deprivation, and social and
family circumstances all contributing to increased levels of mental illness 
[@nhsd2017cypmh].

Across Leeds, comparison with prevalence studies [@nhsd2017cypmh] has suggested 
that only 36% of the expected population at risk is receiving mental health
support, with variations across key factors such as sexual identity and social 
and family circumstances unknown. This study aims to extend research around this
area, and aims to answer the following questions:

> Has the mental health service across Leeds met the needs of children and young 
people (C&YP; aged 11-25), and to what extent has the service been used across 
the different communities throughout Leeds? Does this reflect the demographic 
picture identified by national prevalence modelling?

> What pathways for referral are used by C&YP, and how does entry into the 
service and contact once in the service vary across different communities? What
effect if any does the transition of care from child/adolescent to adult 
services have on people's outcomes? How do pathways differ from acute care into 
dedicated mental health services after mental health related inpatient spells?

> What, if any, impact has the COVID 19 pandemic had on referrals, service use 
and outcomes for this cohort?

By looking at both the coverage of mental health services across Leeds
and the pathways of people once they're in contact with the service, we can
get a full view of the key areas of need for communities.

## Data 
All NHS data-sources used in analysis were available at patient level and were 
routinely collected, with linkage enabled for most patients via a pseudonymised
NHS Number. External data sets were linked in on geography level. The following 
data sources were used in analysis:

* Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS), comprising data from all NHS-funded 
  mental-health organisations. Data included patient lists and associated
  demographics; referrals, including sources, routes, and outcomes; and care
  contacts/activities. Data did not include IAPT referrals or IAPT care 
  contacts.
* Secondary Uses Service (SUS), comprising data from all secondary care
  providers. Data included inpatient, outpatient, and accident and emergency.
* Yorkshire Ambulance Service Data (YAS), including 111 calls.
* Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), comprised of data for
  patients with anxiety and depression.
* Primary Care Records for all Leeds-registered patients (from EMIS & SystmOne)
* Mortality data
* Office of National Statistics census data and population estimates
* LSOA level deprivation data (Indices of Deprivation)

## Design

Four main outputs were identified through discussion with a Task and Finish 
Group (TFG), consisting of Leeds Networked Data Lab (NDL) analysts, mental 
health service users, and mental health service providers. For the first output, 
we aimed to frame patterns of service use and inequalities in service 
provision through descriptive statistics across key factors. Output two was 
aimed to quantify patterns of access to mental health services, investigating 
referral sources and routes, and breaking these down further by demographic 
factors. Output three looked at the effect of the CAMHS-to-AMHS transition, and 
more generally the causes of patient dropout. Additionally, in output three we 
investigated non-dedicated mental health service usage, looking at inpatient 
spells and comparing patient demographics with those within the mental health 
service, and analysing patient post-crisis episode entry into the mental health 
service. Finally, in output four, we quantified the change in the mental health
service due to the COVID-19 pandemic and look at the effects on patients before,
during, and after the national lockdowns.

It was highlighted by the TFG that a significant amount of work in the past had
been performed which focussed on people with depression and anxiety disorders, 
while relatively little had been done on people with more complex conditions. As
such, it was decided that we would focus on non-IAPT services, as these were 
more likely to cover a range of conditions and needs, and analysis into these 
would provide the most benefit to services across the city.

Different cohorts were used for these outputs:

* Outputs 1 and 2 were centred upon patients known to the mental health service,
and so all patients referred to dedicated mental health services (i.e. all 
patients recorded within MHSDS) between April 2016 - March 2021, who were 
between 11-25 at age of referral were included, with external data such as 
census/population estimates included for prevalence comparisons.
* Output 3 required a cross-reference with various healthcare records, and so 
patients without a valid Leeds Data Model (LDM) pseudonym were excluded from 
analysis. Output 3 was further split into three segments ("transition", 
"dropout", and "self-harm"), with different inclusion criteria for each segment.
  - Patients with at least one care-contact as a 17-18 year old between April 
  2016 - March 2021 were included in the "transition" segment. The primary data
  set used in this analysis was MHSDS.
  - Patients with at least one care-contact as an 11-25 year old between April 
  2016 - March 2021 were included in the "dropout" segment. The primary data
  set used in this analysis was MHSDS.
  - 11-25 year old patients who attended an inpatient spell with a secondary 
  diagnosis of intentional self-harm or self-poisoning (ICD-10 X60-84) at Leeds 
  Teaching Hospitals between April 2016 - March 2021 were included in the 
  "self-harm" segment. Patients who died during or soon-after their hospital 
  spell were excluded from analysis. The primary data set used in this analysis 
  was SUS, and and MHSDS, IAPT, and GP mental health appointments were used to
  gauge patients' passages into the mental health service post-spell.
* For Output 4, 11-25 year old patients (at time of referral) who were 
referred to a dedicated mental health service between April 2016 - March 2021 
were included for analysis. The primary data set used in this analysis was MHSDS.

### Mental Health Services Data Set Views
MHSDS consists of 54 tables. Providers 
submit data on a monthly basis, with generally two submissions for each 
month (although this can vary). As one submission does not overwrite another
records are duplicated from the time a patient starts contact with the mental
health service to the time of discharge. Additionally, there have been 
modifications to the data structure (with the time-period selected spanning 
three different versions of the data set) leading to different versions of the 
54 tables. Another complication is that the Pseudo NHS Number is held in a 
separate bridging table which is linked to via a Patient ID. There are different 
patient IDs depending on the data version and therefore separate bridging files,
making data linkage to supplementary data sets more complicated. 

To simplify the data set for analysis, views of the main tables were created. 
Each view shows only the data for the latest month and latest submission of each
record, stitching together the different versions and incorporating Pseudo NHS
number to allow for linkage to non-mental health data sets.

### Data Definitions
Some terms are used across analysis, and so definitions are listed here.

* Referral/Service Request - a request made by or on behalf of a patient
to one or more mental health (MHSDS) teams for a distinct package of care. Each referral
has a date the referral was made, along with the date the referral was either
completed, rejected, or cancelled.
* Care contact - a contact with a mental health service (MHSDS) team. Multiple care 
contacts can be made within one referral, as patients complete their care. 
* Care activity - a specific activity within a care contact. Multiple care 
activities can be made within one care contact, for example if multiple 
consultation methods are used. For example, if both telephone and SMS services
are used within one care contact then this may be recorded as two care 
activities within the same contact.
* Crisis referral - a crisis referral is a referral to a specific crisis 
resolution team within the mental health service (MHSDS).
* CAMHS services - Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services are services 
offered to 0-18 year olds, with a transition into adult services occurring at 
some point between the ages of 17-19. Generally within our data, the bulk of NHS
CAMHS services are offered by Leeds Community Healthcare, and most adult services 
are offered by Leeds and York Partnership Foundation Trust. However, multiple 
providers are listed within the data set, each offering services to different 
cohorts. 

# Output 1 - Demographic Summary 

For Output 1, we were keen to get a broad picture of the people accessing 
mental health services across Leeds, both in order to gain an understanding of
associated factors which could increase someone's need to access mental health 
support, and in order to make a comparison with our understanding of the city on
a demographic scale. By comparing the groups of service users to a wider view of
the groups of people living in Leeds, we can probe inequalities in service 
access and look for the largest areas of improvement.

## Data

Overall, 65 495 service requests (referrals) were included in initial assessment of the 
mental health cohort. There were over 17 000 patients with a recorded NHS 
number, but a number of service requests were from patients without an NHS 
number.

Each record was assigned an index of multiple deprivation from the patient’s 
Local Super Output Area (LSOA) and categorised by deprivation 
decile and age band (11-16, 17-19 or 20-25 years). Deprivation data was taken
from the English Indices of Deprivation, which categorise a number of different
factors influencing a person's level of deprivation. The Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD) is a combination of these factors commonly used in subsetting
data. As one of these factors is related to healthcare usage (for both physical 
and mental health services) and life-expectancy, this variable was removed from
the calculation of the IMD score, to reduce correlating variables with 
themselves.

It should be noted that the mental health data reporting has changed several 
times between April 2016 to 31st September 2021 and time series analysis showed 
inconsistent reporting in the first 12-18 months. Therefore, minor 
inconsistencies between cohort descriptive statistics and later analysis may be 
reported here, as some early data was removed to optimise the time series 
modelling process. 

Initial analysis focussed on demographic variables and supplementary variables 
which were considered important by service providers from Leeds’ TFG. 
While general population descriptors were of interest to the group 
(such as differences by age, sex, ethnic background, and deprivation level), 
further demographic factors were of particular interest to the TFG. These 
included sexuality and sexual identity (including splitting by transgender 
identity), whether the service users had parental responsibility, whether they 
were looked-after children, whether they were young carers, and whether they 
were on a Child Protection Plan. Unfortunately, data inspection showed that 
information about most of these supplementary factors was scarce. While this was
reported to the mental health providers and so may help future analysis, this 
excludes analysis on these factors for this work.

## Analysis

Demand for mental health services varied across a range of demographic factors.
For dedicated mental health (MHSDS) patients, across all ages there were 
significantly more female service users than male users (female users comprising
$\sim 60\%$ of the total users), and this ratio varied by age; the imbalance was
greatest between 15-19 year old patients (Fig. \@ref(fig:ageChart), left). This
imbalance was also seen in the number of care contacts split by gender (Fig.
\@ref(fig:ageChart), right), with the same increase in number of female service
users occurring between 15-18 (peaking at around 75% female patient proportion
for 15 year olds).

```{r ageChart, file = "chunks/ageChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "(left) Proportion of female (red) and male (blue) service users by age at earliest referral, with the proportion numerators and denominators coming from the number of service users split by age at first referral and gender, and the number of service users split by age at first referral , respectively. (right) Proportion of female (red) and male (blue) care contacts by age. The numerator and denominator are the number of care contacts split by age at contact and gender, and the number of care contacts split by age at contact, respectively."}
```

Service usage was imbalanced across deprivation levels. Mid-year population 
estimates of 11-25 year old residents in Leeds (2019) were used to calculate 
proportions of numbers of patients, referrals, and crisis referrals split by 
deprivation deciles (Fig. \@ref(fig:deprivationCharts)).
Proportionally more people who live in areas of high deprivation use the mental 
health service than those who live in areas of lower deprivation, although it is
interesting to note that there is a slight uptick in the proportion of patients
coming from the least deprived areas (Fig. \@ref(fig:deprivationCharts) top left).
Not only are proportionally more people who live in more deprived areas in 
contact with mental health services, they are also requiring more referrals (Fig. \@ref(fig:deprivationCharts) bottom left), and
are experiencing double the rate of crises than those in the areas of 
lowest deprivation (Fig. \@ref(fig:deprivationCharts) top right). Here "crises"
are defined as referrals to a dedicated mental health crisis team.

```{r deprivationCharts, file = "chunks/deprivationChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "(top left) Estimated percentage of the population using mental health service within the five-year period, split by deprivation decile, with binomial 95% confidence intervals denoted. (top right) Average number of crisis referrals per patient, split by deprivation decile, with poisson 95% confidence intervals denoted. (bottom left) Average number of total referrals per patient, split by deprivation decile, with poisson 95% confidence intervals denoted. (bottom right) Average number of crisis referrals per referral, split by deprivation decile, with binomial 95% confidence intervals denoted. In all plots, 1 = most deprived, 10 = least deprived. For all plots, each patient is counted once, and their average deprivation score is calculated if they lived in multiple LSOAs. Population denominators from (top left) are drawn purely from ONS 2019 estimates."}
```


```{r ethnicityMsoa, file = "chunks/ethnicityChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Proportion of patients from a BAME background vs proportion of residents from a BAME background. Points show the values for each MSOA, the solid black line shows the 1:1 line, and the dashed blue line shows the linear fit to the data (with the intercept set at 0)."}
```

Using the 2011 census, the numbers of patients from Black, Asian, and Minority 
Ethnic (BAME) was compared to the population. Rather than simply calculating the 
overall (2016-2021) proportion of BAME patients and comparing this to the (2011) 
proportion of BAME residents within Leeds, we calculated this rate per area to 
test whether any inequalities were held on a city-wide level, rather than purely 
focussed in a few specific areas. It should be noted that for this analysis we 
have assumed that the rate of BAME residents per MSOA has remained unchanged 
since 2011, which is likely to be increasingly wrong over time, with the 2021 
population denominators being ten years out of date. A future comparison with 
the 2021 census data upon release would allow for testing of this assumption.

For each Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), the proportions of both BAME 
patients and BAME residents were calculated, and for those MSOAs where there 
were at least 25 patients the two proportions were compared 
(Fig. \@ref(fig:ethnicityMsoa)). Patients with no ethnicity information recorded 
were discounted from analysis. Ideally, the proportion of patients from a BAME
background should closely match the proportion of residents from a BAME
background, however this is not seen. We find a continued deficit trend, with 
$\sim `r format(round(unname(coef(linear_fit)), 2), digits = 2)`$ [95% CI: 
`r format(round(confint(linear_fit)[1], 2), digits = 2)`,
`r format(round(confint(linear_fit)[2], 2), digits = 2)`] the number of patients 
from BAME background seen than expected. This comparison was also made on a 
per-year basis with comparable figures (see [Appendix 2](#appendix3)), although 
the full five-year comparison is kept here to better constrain confidence 
intervals.

```{r ageGenderDeprivationChart, file = "chunks/ageGenderDeprivationYearly.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "(top left) Proportion of the Leeds population in contact with the mental health service across deprivation quintiles and split by year. Here, quintile 1 refers to the most deprived population, and 5 refers to the least deprived.(top right/bottom left) Change in proportion of the Leeds population in contact with the mental health service, split by deprivation quintile (top right), and gender (bottom left). (bottom right) Variation of the proportion of the Leeds population in contact with the mental health service across the full age range, split by year. In all figures, error bars/shaded ribbons represent the binomial 95% confidence level."}
```

Next, looking at the yearly service usage, it is clear that service take-up has 
increased substantially. Across all deprivation levels we see relatively linear 
increase in the proportion of the population using services, however the rate of
increase is not equal across all deprivation quintiles, with the most and least 
deprived areas featuring the most rapid increase in service use. Inequalities in
service use were also seen in the gender-split of patients; where in 2016 the
proportion of the male population of Leeds roughly matched the proportion of the 
female population, service usage increased far more rapidly among girls/women, 
leading to a much higher proportion of girls/women by 2021 (around 4.5% of the
population, compared to around 2.7% of the population for boys/men). Similarly, 
the increased take-up has differed across ages, with the most rapid increases 
being seen for 14-17 year olds.

# Output 2 - Referral Routes and Services Accessed 

For the second output, we looked at the methods of entry into the mental health
service, along with the routes taken through the service by patients. Our aim
here was to both look for key relationships, and to gauge data suitability for 
further modelling. The primary data source for this output was MHSDS.

As in Output 1, the supplementary variables of interest (sexual identity, 
parental responsibility, young carer, looked after child status, and child 
protection plan status) were extremely inconsistent over the five year data set,
with very low recording rates. Equally difficult was the fact that some patients
had multiple entries for the same variable, leading to difficulties in analysing 
the data properly. Due to these reasons, these variables were again removed for
analysis, along with patients with no recorded NHS Number.

It was difficult to determine referral routes due to poor population of key 
fields, especially when broken down by age band. Furthermore, the coding of services
lacked granularity and categorised referral routes very broadly. Most service 
requests were from Primary Care (GP practices) and internal referrals. The main 
other routes for adults were self-referrals, acute secondary care and the 
justice system. Children and young people were also referred by local 
authorities and education services/educational establishments. Unfortunately, 
the source of referral was not recorded for a quarter of referrals. A full list 
of the number of patients referred via different sources is shown in 
[Appendix 3](#appendix4). 

There was little clinical information about patients’ mental health disorder 
recorded, with around 1.4% (916/65495) of all referrals having a primary diagnosis assigned, 
making it difficult to understand why specific service users were accessing 
services. Attempts to make proxy identification of mental health disorders from 
the variables available were unsuccessful, making it difficult to compare 
with national prevalence data and limited use in further modelling. Members of 
the Task and Finish group said that clinicians were reluctant to diagnose young 
people with disorders due to stigma surrounding mental health and impact on the 
patient’s personal life, which could compound their problems. Furthermore, 
feedback from commissioners working on mental health pathways say there is 
variety in the clinical systems used by providers, how data is recorded and what
is submitted. It is also possible that providers hold diagnoses but there are 
contractual limitations on submissions to MHSDS, due to legacy ‘minimum’ mental 
health services data policies which preceded MHSDS and have not been updated.

Other fields were available but, again, they were poorly populated 
making it difficult to compare between age bands or any other sub-population. 
Over 45% (31649/65495) of service requests did not have a primary reason for referral. 
Otherwise, the most common reasons amongst 11–16 year-olds were anxiety, 
self-harm, neurodevelopmental conditions, depression and eating disorders. 
Interestingly, the top three reasons for 17–19 year-olds to access services 
were "unknown", depression and self-harm, showing similarities in the recorded 
reasons for referral, but great differences in the amount of missing data. 
However, while these services were generally used similarly across these age 
bands, crisis service usage varied by age, with almost three times more crisis 
referrals coming from adults than children and young people.  A full list of the 
number of patients referred for different reasons is shown in 
[Appendix 4](#appendix5). 

The specific teams that service users accessed were not recorded in the data, 
but a grouping of team types was present and was well populated (89% complete: 
58206/65495 referrals). Community 
mental health teams, single point of access services, psychiatric liaison 
services and crisis resolution teams were most in demand in all age bands. While
these team types are very broad and offer little information as to the types of 
service offered to service users (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, group 
therapy, counselling, etc), we are still able to look at patterns of use across
these broad groupings in further analysis. A full list of the number of patients
using different service team types is shown in [Appendix 5](#appendix6). 

# Output 3 - Transition Analysis and Referral Modelling 

The third output focussed on two major themes - firstly, the theme of patients
not staying within the service. This was looked at in two distinct but related 
methods: firstly by looking at patients who had continuous care as they 
transitioned from CAMHS to adult services we aimed to find key characteristics
which influenced any person's likelihood of successfully transitioning, in order
to assess equity across a range of demographic factors. Secondly, we looked more
generally at the factors associated with any patients likelihood of dropping out
of the service, either through self-discharge or repeated non-attendence of 
appointments. These two methods are discussed separately below.

Finally, we investigated pathways into the mental health service and aimed to
study referral equity by including further data sets, and comparing the mental
health service users with patients attending hospital. To do this, we looked 
specifically at patients attending an inpatient spell for injuries or poisoning
related to self-harm, and assessed the demographic, healthcare-related, and 
service-related factors which influenced how broadly patients were entering the
mental health service post-crisis spell.

## CAMHS/AMHS Transition

The time around when a person moves from childhood services to
adult services is well known to be a problem within mental health services,
with poor continuation of care causing a significant number of patients to leave
the mental health service [@singh_camhs]. Looking specifically at the retention
of mental health service users in Leeds, this finding is replicated, with a 
sharp drop in proportion of patients still accessing services one year later
between 17-19; when patients transfer from CAMHS teams to AMHS teams (Fig. 
\@ref(fig:mhRetention)). 

As a verification, this statistic was calculated in two separate
ways: firstly (as shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:mhRetention)) by taking each person's
age at referral, and seeing the proportion of people who have a care-contact 
when they are one year older (for example, if a person is referred at 16, we 
calculate the percentage of people who then have further care-contacts once they
are 17). Secondly, this was calculated by purely seeing the proportion of people
who were seen one year after each care-contact, and then grouping these by age
at contact (for example, if a 16 year old person is seen at 2017/01/01, we 
calculate the percentage of people who then have care contacts between 
2018/01/01 to 2018/12/31). These two methods return different absolute values, 
but similarities in the trends across ages can be seen (see 
[Appendix 6](#appendix7)).

Interestingly it can be seen that the retention of 
both C&YP services and adult services (19+) are relatively stable, with a steady
but sharp transition starting at patients aged 17. One possible theory for this
is that adult services are more focussed on shorter-term packages of care than 
C&YP services.

```{r mhRetention, file = "chunks/transitionChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Percentage of patients who are still in contact (i.e. have made a referral or completed a care contact/activity) with the mental health service one year later, split by age. Binomial 95% confidence intervals are displayed."}
```

While there are numerous particular reasons why each specific patient would not 
continue treatment, we are able to draw conclusions about equity of care by 
looking more generally at the passage of different larger demographic groups
from CAMHS to AMHS services. To achieve this, we subset the initial cohort by 
reducing the data down to to only those patients who have
been able to access CAMHS services near the transition threshold (those $17$, or
$18$), in order to look at those who continue services into adulthood ($19+$).

Next, each patient was flagged as *successfully transitioning* if they attended
both CAMHS services and *at least one* adult service. This is a major 
oversimplification, and while it would be significantly better to look instead
at pattern of use (by looking at the number of care contacts received by each
patient as they transition, and seeing whether care is consistent) we have made
this simplification purely to look at the overarching factors which influence 
patients attending even one adult service. A combination of this work and the
following dropout work can be used to examine specific factors which tend to 
lead to patient non-attendance.

A complication in defining teams was highlighted in Output 2, but as no team
names were known we were unable to perfectly define CAMHS and AMHS services.
Instead, we assumed that all patients below 18 were accessing CAMHS services, 
and patients 18 and over were referred to AMHS services. This was broadly 
verified by considering the provider for each specific care package; as 
mentioned previously the two largest providers focus on CAMHS services
(Leeds Communities Healthcare) and adult services (Leeds and York Partnership 
Foundation Trust), and while there is some crossover this accounted for roughly 
5% of total care contacts for each provider. 

A simple generalised linear (binomial) model (GLM) was used to predict each 
patient's probability of staying in contact with the service next year, and the 
effects of a number of factors (both demographic and relating to prior service 
use) were assessed through odds ratios. Regression variables included were: 
demographic (patient gender, ethnic background, mean deprivation decile of all
residences), and historic (number of referrals, number of service teams, number 
of care-contacts, proportion of previous contacts not attended, referral-first 
contact waiting time in days, and total contact duration in minutes). 
Deprivation values for patients with no LSOA recorded were imputed as decile 5 
- the median deprivation decile for 11-25 year old residents of Leeds based upon
the 2019 mid-year population estimates. It was hypothesised from discussion with
providers that patients from Asian backgrounds (particularly South Asian 
backgrounds) were less likely to seek mental health support, and preferred to 
seek community support alternatively.

### Results
Modelling transition likelihood based upon demographic factors (age, gender, 
ethnic background, derivation level) and service history (number of previous
referrals/care contacts/teams accessed, average waiting time from referral to
first care contact, total contact duration, and proportion of care contacts 
not attended) showed that there were no significant differences in transition
probability across people from different ethnic backgrounds (Fig. 
\@ref(fig:transitionOdds)). Similarly, the
average waiting time had little effect on a person's outcome during the 
transition period. 

However, there were significant differences found by deprivation - with 
increased deprivation leading to reduced chances of successfully transitioning
to adult services (OR: 0.92 - 0.96 per increasing deprivation decile). 
Interestingly, the number of referrals made and number of service teams accessed
had opposite effect on transition likelihood (referral OR: 0.55 - 0.72, service 
teams OR: 1.29 - 1.65). Finally, a person's gender has been found to have a 
significant effect on transition likelihood, with female service users 
displaying a reduced chance of successfully entering adult services (OR: 0.63 -
0.86).

```

<!-- ## Dropout Analysis -->

<!-- While the CAMHS-AMHS transition is a significant issue, more broadly it is still of interest to determine any related factors which influence whether a patient within the mental health service will continue with their journey from referral through to clinician-led discharge. As such, rather than looking at specific factors affecting probability of transitioning, we can instead look at the factors which will affect whether a patient will continue their treatment to completion, or whether they will discharge themselves prior to completion. -->

<!-- ### Method -->

<!-- Each referral into the service can have three outcomes: "scheduled closure" if the referral was completed or closed by the clinician, "patient dropout" if the referral was closed unexpectedly, via patient request or patient recurrent non-attendance, or the referral can be "censored" if it is still open. -->

<!-- We modelled the likelihood of these outcomes for each referral in two ways. Firstly, we ran a simple Cox proportional hazards regression model (package: survival, @survival-package) comparing "dropouts" to everything (grouping scheduled closures and censored data together for simplicity). The strength of this model is its relative simplicity both in implementation and analysis; however by removing the possibility of a referral being closed by a clinician this can over-simplify patient pathways and result in incorrect results. -->

<!-- To account for the two separate endpoints referrals can encounter, we also used a Competing Risks Regression (CRR) Model (Fine-Gray, @finegray1999) (package: cmprsk2 @cmprsk2). In this model, rather than defining a single Kaplan-Meier estimate from which to fit a regression model, a Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) is instead generated which estimates the marginal probability for each competing event. The CIF curve is then used as a sub-distribution function, corresponding to the Cox proportional hazard model. -->

<!-- The data was processed to select one record per referral, with both patient demographic information and referral specific information present for modelling. The demographic information included patient age, sex, ethnic background and mean deprivation decile (accounting for potential moves during treatment). Referral information included primary consultation medium (in the case where multiple methods of consultation medium were used, the most frequent medium was selected), referral team, and waiting time from referral to first care-contact. -->


<!-- ### Results -->

<!-- The full results are listed in [Appendix 1](#appendix1), while the key outputs are reported here. Where hazard ratios are reported, the reported range compasses the 95% confidence interval. -->

<!-- #### Ethnicity: -->
<!-- In terms of relationship to a patient's ethnic background, both the Cox and CRR models found the patients from Asian backgrounds were significantly more likely to dropout than those patients from a white background (HR: 1.09-1.70), and patients from Black backgrounds were significantly less likely to dropout (HR: 0.42-0.90). No significant differences in numbers of scheduled closures were found. -->

<!-- #### Sex: -->
<!-- No significant relationship was found in either model, both for dropout probability and probability of scheduled closure. -->

<!-- #### Deprivation: -->
<!-- Both Cox and CRR models found that with increasing deprivation, the probability of dropout increased (HR: 1.05-1.08) and the probability of scheduled closure slightly decreased (HR: 0.98-0.99). -->

<!-- #### CAMHS vs AMHS: -->
<!-- The CRR model found that CAMHS services were more likely to feature referral dropout than AMHS services (HR: 1.22-1.43) and less likely to feature scheduled closures (HR: 0.72-0.77). No significant difference was found between CAMHS and AMHS referral patterns within the Cox model. -->

<!-- #### Primary Consultation Medium: -->
<!-- Interestingly, compared with face-to-face communication, telephone and SMS services were found to be less likely to feature dropout (HR: 0.59-0.72 and 0.54-0.89 respectively) and and more likely to feature scheduled closures (HR: 1.34, 1.46 and 1.16, 1.41 respectively) in CRR models. However, when using the simpler Cox model the inverse was found, with Telephone and SMS consultations both resulting in more frequent dropouts than face-to-face consultations (HR: 1.04-1.27 and 1.33-2.15 respectively). However, this is likely a feature of the over-simplification of the Cox model. -->

<!-- #### Referral Team Type: -->
<!-- Using community mental health teams as a baseline, crisis team referrals were found to be significantly less likely to experience dropout in CRR models (HR: 0.77-0.97), and Non-IAPT psychological therapy services were significantly more likely to feature dropout (HR: 4.25-5.37) and less likely to experience scheduled closures (HR: 0.28-0.34). Similarly to above, an interesting inverse relationship was found with crisis team referrals via the Cox model. However, as above this was assumed to be due to the flagging of legitimate "scheduled" closures as "censored". -->

<!-- #### Waiting Time: -->
<!-- No significant relationship between waiting time and referral outcome in the CRR model, and an extremely weak increase in dropout probability was found with waiting time increase (HR: 0.99-0.99) in the Cox model. -->

## Inpatient Spells (Self-Harm)

### Background
While the first two parts of Output 3 focussed on the pathways of patients as 
they moved within the mental health service, it is also of interest to consider 
patients not-necessarily registered to the service, to examine differences in 
the numbers of patients in receipt of secondary care for mental illnesses and
the numbers of patients using dedicated mental health services. 

It is particularly important to consider patients who attend hospital for 
injuries or illnesses related to self-harm or self-poisoning for a number of 
reasons. Firstly, these represent patients who have urgent mental health needs, 
and both single and repeated incidences of self-harm inpatient spells have been 
shown to significantly increase a person's risk of suicide. Secondly, it has
been shown that the rate of self-harming significantly rises around adolescence,
particularly for girls and women (see @self2004short for a thorough review).

After an episode of self-harm, NICE guidance [@self2004short] recommends that 
each inpatient receives a psychiatric assessment within 48 hours of admission, 
and a decision to refer to a dedicated mental health be made with the patient, 
depending upon the need of the patient. Most patients attending an emergency 
department visit after a self-harm episode meet the criteria for a psychiatric 
diagnosis [@haw_hawton_houston_townsend_2001], and so ideally the intersection of 
patients attending hospital following self-harm and patients in contact with the 
mental health service would be close to complete. However, this could vary due
to a range of factors, such as hospital provision for mental health support, 
the age of the patient (with young people being referred through different 
routes to older people), and patient preference depending upon each patient's 
background and beliefs.


### Data and Initial Investigation

Between 2016-04-01 and 2021-03-31, there were 3591 inpatient spells with a
diagnosis (primary or secondary) of self-harm (ICD-10 X60-84) at Leeds Teaching
Hospitals. Of these, roughly 70% (2525) of spells resulted in a referral to a
mental health team within a week, although the proportion of non-referrals was
not uniform across all factors. In order to look deeper into these factors,
the patient outcome (i.e. decision to refer or not) was predicted using two 
methods to allow for both comparison with the true outcome, and to determine
each factor's influence on the outcome. While additional information such as 
general inpatient admissions for mental health conditions or A&E attendances 
could have been added, we decided to limit the data to only those patients 
admitted for an inpatient spell to firstly limit scope and increase simplicity 
of analysis, and secondly due to complications in coding differences between
A&E attendances and inpatient admissions.

Initially, a strong relationship between referral status and patient age was
found (Fig. \@ref(fig:mhReferAgeDate), left), with a significant rise in number of 
non-referrals occurring around age 17-19. This possibly represents the difference
in either hospital policy for referrals, or a change in patient preference.

When comparing numbers of patients attending hospital by date (Fig. \@ref(fig:mhReferAgeDate), right), 
a large drop in patient attendances was found around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, despite this the number of patients referred to the mental health 
service has stayed roughly consistent, with a drop in non-referrals around March
2020 and a small but steady increase after the initial national lockdown.

```{r echo = FALSE, file = "chunks/selfHarmSpellData.R"}
```

```{r mhReferAgeDate, file = "chunks/ipReferralChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "(left) Percentage of patients not referred to the Mental Health service within one week. Error bars denote 95% binomial confidence intervals. (right) Number of patients attending hospital for self-harm, split by post-crisis referral status (red being non-referrals and blue referrals). Figures are two-monthly averaged to increase signal-to-noise."}
```

Within the data set, a further range of variables were considered, to infer any 
influence on referral status post-crisis. These were demographic (patient
age, sex, ethnic background, average decile of deprivation), spell related (date of spell, 
length of stay, whether the spell was alcohol/narcotics related, whether a 111
call was made, whether the patient self-discharged), history related (whether 
the patient had presented previously for a self-harm spell, whether the patient 
was known to the mental health service), and service related (how many self-harm 
patients had presented at the hospital within the past week). The 
service capacity related metric was included after interest in seeing whether
any relationship existed between higher times of capacity and lower throughput
into the mental health service was raised. Eleven patients 
died at hospital and forty patients did not have a recorded NHS Number so were 
excluded from analysis.

### Modelling
Data was split into train (80%) and test (20%) datasets, and the training dataset
was further grouped into three sub-groups for three-fold cross validation when
hyperparameter tuning. When splitting the full dataset into test/train, the data
were sampled such that the proportion of non-referrals to referrals was roughly
consistent.

Around 9% of patients did not have an LSOA listed as their primary residence, 
and so for these patients no deprivation information could be determined. 
Missing deprivation data was imputed by giving assuming these patients resided
in an area of deprivation decile 5 (the median decile for Leeds residents) -
slightly artificially inflating that decile's true score. All other variables 
were fully recorded so no further imputation was necessary. Dummy variables 
were created from all nominal variables using the package caret [@caret]. All
data imputation and variable dummification was based upon the training data and
applied to the test data, to avoid data leakage.

Two models were considered. Initially, due to its speed and predictive power, 
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, @2016arXiv160302754C) was used to predict 
each patient's probability of *not* being referred post-crisis. Secondly, an 
ensemble model was used, in order to see whether the combination of multiple
models would improve predictive power. The ensemble model was made from a stack
of five models: a binomial generalised linear model (@rstats), a random forest 
model (@randomForest), a linear support vector machine (SVM) model (@svm), a 
single-layer neural network (NN) (@nnet), and the above XGBoost model. Data were
centred and scaled prior to running the NN and SVM, with the centre and width
values taken from the training data set to avoid data leakage.

While a simpler GLM would have given more easily interpretable variable effects
on referral outcomes, we chose to use more complex models for a number of 
reasons. Primarily, more complex models better handle non-linear interactions
between features, allowing us to look more specifically at the pathways of 
different sub-cohorts, and see the effects of different features on each. 
Secondly, initial scoping with GLM and more complex models showed improved 
performance for the complex models, better identifying individuals at higher 
risk of non-referral, allowing us to better understand the characteristics of
these patients.

All models were individually tuned using three-fold cross validation, and the
F-score ($2 \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}$) 
was maximised to determine the optimal hyperparameters. 
When ensembling, the models were combined using a greedy optimisation, 
maximising the precision-recall area under the curve (AUCPR). A description of 
each model and the hyperparameters which were tuned over is found in [Appendix 1](#appendix2). 

Each model was run with the same seed, the same test/train split, and the same 
cross-validation groups to ensure that results were comparable. To estimate 
confidence, each model was run 80 times, and average models were constructed
along with confidence intervals.

### Results and Discussion
While both models had similar Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves 
(and hence similar areas under the ROC curve), it should be noted that the data
was slightly imbalanced, with around twice as many patients being referred than
not (or twice as many negative classes than positive). While this is not a 
severe class imbalance, it was determined that it was large enough to that
model comparisons should be made using Precision-Recall curves.

```{r file = 'chunks/modelSpecs.R', include = FALSE}
```

Comparing the models (Fig. \@ref(fig:prCurve)), over all runs the XGBoost model had AUCPR `r auc_ci$xg_pr_auc[2]` [95% CI: `r auc_ci$xg_pr_auc[1]`, `r auc_ci$xg_pr_auc[3]`], and the ensembled model had AUCPR `r auc_ci$en_pr_auc[2]` [95% CI: `r auc_ci$en_pr_auc[1]`, `r auc_ci$en_pr_auc[3]`]. Given the class imbalance, a baseline "no knowledge" 
predictor which predicted random values along the imbalance ratio (2.33 : 1 
referred) would achieve an AUCPR of ~0.22.
The difference in models is more significant at lower recall values, 
representing the success in the ensemble model at classifying more certain 
predictions correctly. At higher values the models performed broadly similarly,
meaning that the ensemble model was no better at classifying the less certain
predictions. As the ensemble model performed better both overall and for the 
most precise predictions, further analysis focussed only on this model.

```{r prCurve, file = 'chunks/plotModelSpecs.R', echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Precision recall curves for the XGBoost models (black) and ensembled models (red). Each model run is shown via a thin line, with thicker lines showing the average model curve. The blue dashed line shows the 'no-skill' value which would be achieved through either choosing one class only, or randomly assigning positive or negative values to each patient."}
```

The effect of each variable on the final prediction from the ensemble model was
next evaluated (Fig. \@ref(fig:vip)), to determine the most significant factors.
Generally it was found that, aside from patient age, the spell-level and 
hospital-level information was more important to the model than patient 
demographic-level information, with the next five variables coming from these
sources. It was found that the top six features accounted for around 85% of the
model importance, with the bottom nine accounting for the remaining $\sim15\%$.

As expected from the initial investigation, each patient's age played the 
largest role in deciding their pathway into the mental health service, 
accounting for around 30% of the feature importance. Important predictors were
whether a patient had previously attended Leeds Teaching Hospital for one or 
more inpatient spells related to self-harm, or whether they were known to the 
mental health service at time of admission. The hospital capacity was found to 
be important to the prediction accuracy.

```{r vip, file = "chunks/variableImportanceChart.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Variable importance for the ensembled model prediction. The bars show the median importance (scaled to sum to 100) and the 95% confidence interval is shown via the error bars."}
```

To estimate each variable's specific effect on the model outcome, we calculated 
the average partial dependence per feature. Partial dependence (PD)
(@friedman2001greedy, R package: @dalex) is an estimation of the marginal effect 
of a feature on predicted model outcome. An assumption of variable independence
is required to estimate PD, which is seen in most features within our data - 
with exceptions being a correlation between patient "previous crisis spell flag" 
and patient "known to mental health service" flag ($r = 0.53$), and 
anti-correlations between patient ethnic backgrounds. While local explainations
via explainers such as SHAP or LIME can be more useful in some cases, PD plots
give the advantages that they are both easy to implement and are intuitively 
understandable, with the dependence score simply corresponding to the average
change in predicted probability with each change in the variable.

The PD plots for the top six variables from variable importance calculations are
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:pdp). Of note are the effect of one or more previous 
crisis spell increasing non-referral probability by around 20-40%, and the 
effect of a patient being known to the mental health service previously 
increasing their probability of non-referral. While the number of referrals has 
stayed roughly consistent over the past five years, there is a slight increase 
in non-referral probability with increased hospital attendance in the previous 
week, although the differences are very minor. Interestingly, as deprivation 
level increases, the probability of non-referral decreases. Finally, the longer
a patient stays in hospital the lower their probability in non-referral, 
potentially signifying that the highest-risk patients are being referred 
consistently while lower-risk patients are not.

```{r pdp, file = "chunks/partialDependencePlots.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Partial dependence plots from the ensembled model. Points show the calculated average partial dependence for each model run, error bars show the 95% confidence interval over all model runs, and red lines show the smoothed fit to the data. Histograms above each variable show the relative distribution of spells split by the variable."}
```

# Output 4 - Time Series Analysis
## Data used and linkages 

While referrals between 2016-04-01 and 2021-03-31 were considered for the above analysis, for time series analysis it was determined that a slightly different time-period should be used. In early 2017, a new version of MHSDS was released, resulting in a step change in recorded referrals. To account for this, the time-window was shifted, and Mental health service requests between May 2017 and September 2021 were considered. The referral counts were categorised by Gender, IMD Quintile, Age-Band and Ethnicity. There was also an attempt to compare requests to crisis services versus other services, and requests to CAMHS versus Adult services pre-COVID, during the first wave, and after the first wave. 

Both service requests (referrals) and care contacts data were available, but time series analysis was limited to new service requests due to time constraints. However, there is potential to extend this analysis to care contacts (types) attended (and cancelled/missed) which could yield further insight to the patterns identified here.  

Time series data was standardised and summarised at quarterly, monthly and weekly unit time. Given the period available, changes in mean/variance and processing required (holidays etc), monthly data was selected as it allowed consistent analysis of features across the variables of interest. It should be noted that variables were categorized quite broadly, making substantial assumptions, and sacrificing details about patient subsets to maximise the data available. 

Monthly service requests were initially compared with outcomes (service discharges) to estimate how the underlying population (patients accessing MH services) fluctuated over time. It was expected that service discharges would lag those received and create variation in monthly populations. However, monthly service discharges mirrored service requests which suggests that the underlying population was approximately stable over the series. Due to this, further analysis of referral/discharge differences were not made.

## Methods 

The data set was segmented into three periods; Segment 1 (May 2017 to March 2020; pre-COVID), Segment 2 (March 2020 to September 2020; broadly within the first wave) and Segment 3 (Sept 2020 to Sept 2021; post-first wave). Each segment was assessed for seasonality, trend and extended periodicity. Figure \@ref(fig:referralTimeline) shows that, surprisingly, there was little evidence of pre-COVID seasonal patterns, but there were common features across the variables selected. Therefore, segments were defined to elucidate features of interest, rather than strictly adhering to COVID lockdown dates. 

Given the lack of seasonality and trend in pre-COVID data, plus stable variance (in most cases) a linear model provided a suitable counterfactual to describe changes that occurred due to COVID. Two models were selected to describe key features in the data:

* Mean level changes in Segments 2 and 3 to assess the ‘peak’ in demand and whether it subsided. 

* Comparison of trend/slope changes in Segments 1 and 3 to assess how quickly service requests have returned to pre-COVID levels (if at all). 

These models have substantial limitations in accurately describing the peak demand and post-first wave slope, but still provide insight into relative variations between category levels. 

```{r referralTimeline, file = "chunks/referralTimeSeries.R", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Ratio of the number of new referrals and discharges over the number of patients making referrals/being discharged, per month. Discharges are shown as red lines and referrals as blue lines, with the shaded areas denoting time-segments for linear trend modelling. Dashed lines show linear fits to S1 and S3 data, for trend direction."}
```

## Results 

#### Gender 

There were only slight differences in service requests received between males and females before, during and after COVID. Female requests increased 61% from pre-COVID levels of an average 1.17 referrals per person, compared to +58% increase from males, which dropped to +27% in Segment 3 compared to +32% males. However, the rate of referral from September 2020 is decreasing quicker for females and it is expected that male service requests will take longer to return to normal pre-COVID levels. There was little data from patients with indeterminate or unknown gender and was not suitable for modelling. 

#### IMD Quintile 

New service requests systematically varied depending on the patient’s deprivation level. Compared to pre-COVID levels, there was a significant increase in referral rates across all levels of deprivation in Segment 2. It ranged from +72% in the most deprived group to +32% in the least deprived group (IMD Quintile 1 to 5 respectively). Service requests in Segment 3 dropped to +20-30% for each quintile, except the third which remained higher at +40%. 

Note that variance in Segment 3 increased which added to uncertainty in determining level changes and slope changes, although the data points were not considered anomalous and likely to represent inconsistent service demand. 

#### Ethnicity 

Relative to pre-COVID levels, there was substantial variation (+50% to +110%) in activity during Segment 2 although it was followed by a decrease across all ethnicities to approximately (+20% to +30%) in Segment 3. Service request rates for most ethnicities continue to decrease, except Black or Black British or Unknown ethnicities which exhibit a slight positive increase. Unfortunately, this data suffered from high variance and volatility before, during and after COVID which adds uncertainty to these conclusions. Furthermore, recorded Ethnic Categories were broadened to reduce noise and make the modelling easier. 

#### Age-Band 

Service requests for 17-19 and 20-25 year olds increased from 1.25 service requests per person before COVID to a maximum of 2.75 and 3.00 service requests per person during Segment 2 This was far larger than the 11-16 years age band which exhibited a much smaller peak during Segment 2 However, where the older age bands are returning to pre-COVID levels, the younger band shows a minor increase in service requests over the Segment 3 period. 

#### CAMHS / Adults  

Categorising the patients as CAMHS or Adults supports the patterns explained above. Unfortunately, it was difficult to determine a change from pre-COVID rates for CAMHS service requests, as pre-COVID data was far more variable than the Segment 2 or 3 data. It is difficult to explain this variance and this data may benefit from re-defining the CAMHS cohort. However, it is notable that the Segment 3 level has increased, and does not show signs of decreasing.  

#### Crisis / Other 

There was a stark increase in crisis service requests (+70%) versus other services (+46%) during Segment 2. However Segment 3 demand for crisis services reduced quickly whilst other services show a longer-lasting request rate which currently persists.

# Discussion

Across this project, there have been a range of desired outcomes. Primarily, we
were interested in a general full-city picture of mental health service usage by
children and young people (11 - 25 year olds), in order to understand two 
separate but related questions: which services are the most heavily demanded 
(or which groups display the most need for assistance) and, by comparison with 
non-mental health data, which services display the highest level of inequity in 
provision (or which groups are least represented within the mental health 
service).

To achieve this goal, we initially processed the Mental Health Services Data Set
(MHSDS), combining different versions and removing multiple duplicate files. By
creating simpler Views of MHSDS, we were able to begin analysing the service use
and linking the data with further data sets. This initial data processing also 
allowed us to gain a fuller understanding of the completeness of the data;
we have found significant lack of data coverage for patient information such as 
parental status, Looked-After Child status, Child Protection Plan status, sexual
identity, and young carer status. The lack of data for these demographic 
indicators was relayed back to the mental health providers for possible future 
analysis, and the scope was narrowed slightly to remove these indicators.

Clear differences in care patterns were seen by looking across demographic 
variables. Significant variations in the gender split of patients occur across
the age range considered, peaking at mid-adolescence where around 70% of all 
patients are female (and around 75% of care contacts are for female patients).
Variations also occur when looking at patient deprivation; when standardised to
the Leeds population we have found that significantly more people in areas of 
higher deprivation require access to the mental health service, with around 1 in
3 more people in the 10% most deprived areas having had access to the service than 
those in the 10% least deprived areas. Compounding this is the finding that 
patients from the 10% most deprived areas require almost 33% more referrals, and 
experience around twice the number of crises than patients from the 10% least 
deprived areas. This demonstrates the significant increase in level of need for
people from these areas. Finally, we considered how equitably services were used
across people from different ethnic groups. Using the 2011 census as a baseline,
we found that only just over half the number of people from Black, Asian, and 
minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were using the service than would be expected
based upon the underlying population, showing significant improvements needed to
ensure equitable care is given to all communities across Leeds.

Next, we focussed on the period of transition, where 17-19 year olds are
transferred from childhood and adolescent services (CAMHS) to adult services 
(AMHS). Consistent with the literature, we found a sustained drop in patient 
retention around this transition age, with around one in five fewer AMHS 
patients remaining in contact with the mental health service one year past a 
referral. Modelling of each patient's transition from CAMHS to AMHS services 
showed a significant drop in transition likelihood with increasing deprivation, 
and found that overall, female patients were less likely to successfully 
transition services than male patients. This result ties in with the demographic
picture of services split by gender; while there are more female patients using 
services, generally as age increases the disparity decreases, with a 
particularly sharp drop in the proportion of female care contacts occurring 
around 17-18. It was also found that each person's previous service use affects
their likelihood of transitioning successfully, with patients who are in contact
with more service teams being found to be more likely to continue care in adult 
services. Interestingly, patients who experience more referrals have a reduced 
probability of transitioning successfully, possibly showing that if a patient is 
re-referred multiple times then they experience worse continuation of care than 
if they are moved between different teams without needing to completely re-refer,
although discussion with service providers is required to test this hypothesis.
Finally, no major differences were found in continuation of care across the 
transition gap for patients from different ethnic backgrounds.

<!-- Broadening our search slightly, we next looked to find factors associated with -->
<!-- patients dropping out of services unexpectedly across all ages, rather than just -->
<!-- across the transition age. By running two different survival models, we  -->
<!-- evaluated both factors relating to patient dropout and factors relating to  -->
<!-- expected closure of services. This was done in order to differentiate between  -->
<!-- services which experience low retention due to patient dropout and those  -->
<!-- which experience low retention due to expected reasons, such as those services  -->
<!-- which solely offer short-term support before onward referral. -->

<!-- We find that -->
<!-- there are significant differences in patient dropout rates across different  -->
<!-- ethnic groups, with Asian/Asian British patients significantly more likely to  -->
<!-- dropout and Black/Black British patients significantly less likely to dropout  -->
<!-- than white patients. Comparing this to the finding that patients from BAME  -->
<!-- backgrounds are underrepresented within the mental health service, this -->
<!-- suggests that both entry to the service and continued service use is a  -->
<!-- significant problem for Asian communities across Leeds. This finding has been  -->
<!-- echoed through conversations with service providers, who noted a barriers to  -->
<!-- entry for people from South Asian communities particularly. Conversely, although  -->
<!-- entry into the service is a problem for those from Black communities, once  -->
<!-- people from Black backgrounds have been referred they are more likely to  -->
<!-- continue using services until discharge by a clinician. It has been noted that  -->
<!-- this could be an indicator that only those with the most intense needs gain  -->
<!-- access to services for people from Black communities, and hence once people are -->
<!-- in the service they are more likely to continue their treatment until the end. -->
<!-- When looking at the breakdown of service team type across different ethnic  -->
<!-- groups, we find that proportionally more crisis and psychosis intervention teams  -->
<!-- are accessed by people from Black backgrounds, potentially validating this  -->
<!-- hypothesis, although further investigation is required. Similarly, we have found  -->
<!-- that again increased deprivation level is correlated with increased dropout  -->
<!-- rate, showing that even though people from more deprived areas are in greater  -->
<!-- need of services (and experience more crises), they are also more likely to drop -->
<!-- out of services, requiring more work to assist people in continuation of care. -->

<!-- Comparing CAMHS and AMHS services, we find that CAMHS services are more likely -->
<!-- to experience patient dropout. This goes against the finding that year-on-year  -->
<!-- patient retention is generally being higher in CAMHS services overall,  -->
<!-- suggesting that possible routes into the service must be more accessible to  -->
<!-- allow re-entry after dropout. Further work should be done to compare the routes -->
<!-- by which CAMHS and AMHS patients re-enter services after dropping out. Finally,  -->
<!-- across all service team types we find that Non-IAPT psychological therapy  -->
<!-- referrals experience patient dropout at a significantly higher rate than  -->
<!-- community mental health services (HR: 4.25-5.37). -->

As a comparison, we next compared non-mental health acute care data with mental 
health referrals, to try to look for possible barriers to service entry. We
focussed on inpatients spells related to self-harm at Leeds Teaching 
Hospitals and looked at the proportion of patients referred into the mental 
health service post-spell. We used a stack of models to predict each patient's 
non-referral probability, based upon demographic information, hospital spell 
information, hospital history data, and service capacity related information. 
We found that the most useful predictors of non-referral was each patient's age,
demonstrating significant differences between CAMHS and AMHS referrals even 
post-crisis. Interestingly, the next most important factors determining
non-referral likelihood were spell-related, history-related, and 
service-related, with patients known to the service and patients who have had 
previous crises significantly less likely to be referred after discharge. We
have found a slight but sustained increase in non-referral probability with 
increased service use within the week prior to each crisis spell, suggesting 
that service capacity may play a role in determining whether patients are able
to access mental health services after a self-harm episode. Finally, we have 
found that interestingly, patients from more deprived areas are slightly *more* 
likely to be referred into mental health services on discharge, showing 
more equitable service use across deprivation levels. 

Finally, we considered the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on services. We 
compared the number of service requests and discharges occurring during three 
time segments: Segment 1 (May 2017 - March 2020), Segment 2 (March 2020 - 
September 2020), and Segment 3 (September 2020 - September 2021), looking for 
both seasonal trends pre-COVID and changes in service usage across demographic 
factors and service 
team types. Across all variables, there was a relatively stable level of service
usage pre-COVID, significant increases in referrals and discharges 
during our Segment 2 time-period, followed by general decreases in service use in Segment 3. 
Generally, during the Segment 2 (first-wave) peak substantially more referrals were made by 
people living in the most deprived areas than those living in the least deprived
areas, displaying the significant increase for need among these areas. We find
that there were similarly stark increase in crisis service use during the peak,
which correlates well with the finding that people from more deprived areas are
significantly more likely to require crisis services than those from less 
deprived areas. Similar disparities were seen across ages, with younger people
(11-16) experiencing a much smaller increase in service use than older people 
(17+), although while service usage decreased post-first wave (Segment 3) for older people, there
is an increase in the number of service requests for younger people.

Overall, while disparities in both access to care and continuation of care have 
been found here, future work should focus on a qualitative investigation into
possible causes of these disparities, in order to assist with future planning. 
Similarly, although simple linear models were found to be good estimators of 
referral and discharge patterns over time, future work should look to extend 
these models to fully investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
mental health service, possibly by using non-linear models to more accurately
assess changes over time, or change-point analysis to precisely pinpoint times
when service use changed significantly, rather than prescribing set periods to
look at.
