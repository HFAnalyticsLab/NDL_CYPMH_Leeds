#### Project Status: In-progress

## Project Description

- This Networked Data Lab analysis by the NDL lab in Leeds focusses on childrens' and young people's (11-25) mental health, particularly disparities in service access between different groups across Leeds, and confounding factors associated with transition from child/adolescent services to adult services.
- Please note that these research outputs have not yet been peer-reviewed and should be treated as preliminary.

## Data sources

This analysis used the following data:

Data included patient lists and associated demographics; referrals, including sources,
routes, and outcomes; and care contacts/activities. Data did not include IAPT referrals or IAPT care
contacts.
- Secondary Uses Service (SUS), comprising data from all secondary care providers. Data included
inpatient, outpatient, and accident and emergency.

depression.
