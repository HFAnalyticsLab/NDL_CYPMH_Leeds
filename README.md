# Networked Data Lab: NDL Leeds analysis on access of childrens' and young people's mental health services and transition to adult mental health services.

#### Project Status: In-progress

## Project Description

- This Networked Data Lab analysis by the NDL lab in Leeds focusses on childrens' and young people's (11-25) mental health, particularly disparities in service access between different groups across Leeds, and confounding factors associated with transition from child/adolescent services to adult services.
- Please note that these research outputs have not yet been peer-reviewed and should be treated as preliminary.
